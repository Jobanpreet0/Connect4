# **Connect4 (Game)** 

## **Description**

The game I developed is called Connect4, drawing inspiration from the original Connect4 game. It's designed for 2 players who take turns inserting their discs into a board where each disc is held individually. The board has a total of 42 spaces for the discs. The objective of the game is to strategically place 4 same-coloured discs in either a row or column, with sideways plays also counting towards this goal.

## **To Play:**

1. Download the folder from GitHub.
2. Open Connect4.sln using Microsoft Visual Studio.
3. Click the start button in VB to run the game.
4. Feel free to use any other IDE if preferred

## **How to play**

**Menu Page:**

The menu page appears when the game is launched. Users can choose from three buttons: "Play" to access the Connect 4 game screen, "How to Play" for instructions on playing and winning, and "Exit" to close the game menu tab.

**Game page:**

On the game screen, two players compete to win. The yellow box on the right indicates the current player's turn based on the colour of the text. For instance, "Blue in Play" means it's the blue player's turn. Numbered buttons are used to drop discs into desired columns. The screen includes a reset button (green) to restart the game and a back button to return to the main menu.

This is the "How to Play" form, providing detailed instructions on playing and winning the game, including button usage for disc placement. It also features a back button for easy navigation to the main menu.

## **Testing**

**Trace facilities and inspection techniques for the examination of variables during program execution**

Utilized the Output Debug tool to monitor the game's opening and closing processes. Additionally, leverage it to check variable values and ensure correct functionality.
